| ![IconFontsVirtualImageListComponentIcon.png](./Packages/IconFontsVirtualImageListComponentIcon.png) | **TIconFontsVirtualImageList** is a special "virtual" ImageList for Delphi linked to an IconFontsImageCollection (only for VCL) to simplify use of "Font Icons" (resize, color and more...) |
| ![IconFontsImageComponentIcon.png](./Packages/IconFontsImageComponentIcon.png) | **TIconFontImage** is an extended Image component for Delphi (VCL+FMX) to show any Icon Font directly or included into a an IconFontsImageList with all functionality (stretch, color, opacity and more...) |
| ![IconFontsImageListComponentIcon.png](./Packages/IconFontsImageListComponentIcon.png) | **TIconFontsImageList** is an extended ImageList for Delphi (VCL+FMX) to simplify use of Icon Fonts (resize, color and more...). Use only for simple application with one form. |

## New Setup for automatic installation of components

From 3.4.0 version a new "Installer" read-to-use is located in the Release area: [Download the Installer](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/releases/latest/download/IconFontsImageList_Setup.exe).

The Installer automatically detect your Delphi versions, install sources, build and install packages and add source paths.

![Setup](./Demo/Images/Setup.png)

### Available from Delphi 7 to Delphi 12 (32bit and 64bit platforms)

Notice: the Installer is not able to automatic compile and install for Delphi 7: you must install it manually as explained [here](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki#installation)

Follow the [guide in Wiki section](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki) to known how to use those components to modernize your Delphi VCL or FMX applications scalable, colored and beautiful with few lines of code.

## Very important notice:

**TVirtualImageList** (available from D10.3) and **TIconFontsVirtualImageList** both use images from **TIconFontsImageCollection**. An important difference is that TVirtualImageList may use and create only a subset of the images in the collection, whereas TIconFontsVirtualImageList creates all images of the collection everytime it is needed (e,g. DPI change), which is slower and consumes more memory.

We advise that TIconFontsVirtualImageList should be used only for versions of Delphi before 10.3. For recent versions of Delphi the recommended combination should be **TIconFontsImageCollection + TVirtualImageList**. Don't forget also the importance of TVirtualImageList.PreserveItems when you have a large ImageCollection with many linked Actions. Without setting this property to "True", everytime you add or remove an icon in the collection, you have to check and change the ImageIndex of all the Actions.

## Demos uses Material Design Icon Fonts ##

All demos included in this repo uses the Material Design Font available [here.](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont) (the file "materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf" is renamed to "Material Design Icons.ttf" and included into **Demo\Fonts** folder)

**Warning: "Material Font" has changed again**

Take care of changed Font file used in the Demos starting from v3.3.2 release, as explained [here](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki/Deploy-Applications).
